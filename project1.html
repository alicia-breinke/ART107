    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p><i>Guiding Lights</i> is a project that was inspired by the grueling exodus of Yeonmi Park, after she escaped from North Korea for the hopes of a better future.  The project is meant to trace some of her trials, of going through mountains and the Mongolian Desert, before arriving in South Korea.  I also wanted to represent the guidance of the North Star and other cosmic objects, which provided guidance during this uncertain time in her life.</p>
